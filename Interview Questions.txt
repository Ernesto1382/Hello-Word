INTERVIEW QUESTION 1 – Tell me about yourself?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Concentrate on telling them about your work-related skills as opposed to your home life. They are not interested in your home life.
    Download a copy of the person specification for the job and focus on telling them how your skills and attributes match the document
    Use “power words” in your response, such as: motivated, enthusiastic, loyal, flexible, committed, honest, hard-working, adaptable etc. These will resonate positively with the interview panel.

SAMPLE ANSWER

“First and foremost, I am a hard-working, loyal and enthusiastic person who understands how important work is to my overall happiness.
I take my work very seriously and I am always looking to improve my skills and qualifications so I can work to the highest standards possible in my role.

I genuinely believe there are 2 types of employee: the first is someone who turns up to work and does their job so they can just pay their bills.
The second employee type is someone who puts their all into their job, is totally committed and does all they can to help their employer achieve their goals. 
I am the second employee type, and I believe my previous track record and strong appraisals demonstrate that.

I have excellent communication skills and fully understand how important it is to deliver outstanding customer care – after all, without the customer, there would be no business and I would not have a job. I also have very good organisational skills and always plan my weeks’ work in advance to make sure I perform to a high standard.

Having studied the person specification for this job in detail, I strongly believe I can perform the role to a high standard and would very much appreciate the opportunity to work for your company. If I am successful today, I can assure you that I will bring a great deal of experience, loyalty and positive qualities to your team.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 2 – Why do you want to work here?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Tell them about the preparation work you have done in the build-up to the interview.
    Focus on the person specification, the job description and information you have gleaned from the company’s website and also the literature you have studied during your research.

SAMPLE ANSWER

“Having studied the person specification and job description for this role, I feel I have the skills, qualities and attributes to carry out the job to a very high standard. I also feel the role will give me a new, fresh challenge; something which I have been looking for, for some time now.

Having also studied your company in detail, there seems to be a very positive approach to the work you carry out and I also very much like the way you strive to deliver a high standard of customer care. High levels of customer care are not common nowadays, and I certainly want to work in a company that looks after its customers as I enjoy seeing positive customer interaction, feedback and testimonials within my job.

Also, during my research I managed to speak to two current employees who work for you, and they had nothing but positive things to say about your company. Both of them have worked for you for quite a few years now and they appeared very happy in their work. If I am successful, I plan to stay with you for a long time, so it was good to see that you employ happy, positive people within your team.

Finally, after reading the job description I understand there will be opportunities to both train, develop and take on further qualifications within the company – this is something that is very much appealing to me as I always like to grow and improve as an employee.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 3 – What are your strengths?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Again, focus on the person specification for the role you are applying for.
    Say something different that makes you stand out from the other job applicants. Give an example of why you are better than the other applicants and try to make yourself RELATABLE and REAL!

SAMPLE ANSWER

“I have many positive qualities and attributes to bring to this role, but I believe my main key strengths are:

    I have a hard-working nature;
    I have an enthusiastic demeanour;
    I am always looking for the positives in every situation;
    I am a great team player;
    I like to support and help develop others;
    I am dependable.

One thing that I feel makes me stand out from the majority of employees is that I am always looking for ways to improve the way I perform at work.

For example, following an appraisal last year, my line manager identified that she wanted me to develop my negotiating skills.

As soon as the appraisal was complete, I searched online for a distance learning negotiating course and studied hard in this area to improve my skills.

Once I had completed the course, and I had the opportunity to put into practice what I had learned, my line manager commented that she had noticed a significant improvement in this area and congratulated me for taking the positive approach to the feedback she gave me at the appraisal.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 4 – Where do you see yourself in 5 years’ time?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Don’t tell them you plan to have moved on from their company, either internally or externally.
    Loyalty is very important to the vast majority of employers. Remember, they have to spend time, money and resources training you up in the role, so they will want to see a return from their investment.
    Don’t tell them you want to be sitting where they are!

SAMPLE ANSWER:

“If I am successful today, the first thing I plan to do is get competent in the role as soon as possible. I have no idea how long this will take; however, based on my high levels of enthusiasm, I aim to get trained up very quickly.

Once I am trained up in the role to a good standard, I would like to consolidate my skills and become experienced within the team. It is very important to me to be accepted and respected by my work colleagues and peers and I also want to do well in my appraisals.

So, I guess the short answer to this question is that I want to become good at my job, be accepted by my team and line managers and also enjoy my work as much as possible.

If the opportunity presents itself for me to progress within the organisation, that would be amazing. All in all, I plan to stay with the company long-term if I am successful at interview.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 5 – What are your weaknesses?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Anyone who tells the interview panel they have no weaknesses is telling porkies! We all have weaknesses.
    Don’t give a weakness that is one of the key requirements of the role. For example, if punctuality and good timekeeping are important, don’t tell the panel you struggle getting out of bed in the morning!

SAMPLE ANSWER

“I do have one weakness, and that is I sometimes get slightly irritated when people don’t carry out their work to a high standard.

Because I set myself high standards, I expect others to have them too, and this is not always the case. Although it can irritate me at times, I have learned to just focus on my own job and do it to a consistently high standard.

Having said that, I have recently been trying to turn this weakness into something positive by helping other people within the working environment to improve. So, if I notice a member of the team struggling, or not performing to the required standard, I will always offer to help them improve, which I feel can only serve to have a positive impact on the organisation and its goals overall.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 6 – What makes a good team player?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    List the qualities I am going to give you in the sample answer that follows.
    Back up your answer with a specific example of when YOU have worked well as part of a team using the STAR technique.

SAMPLE ANSWER

“Effective teamwork is vital in any organisation and I feel what makes a good team member is:

    Having a dedicated leader;
    An ability to focus on the end goal;
    Great communication amongst the team members and its leader;
    A comprehensive initial brief so that every member of the team knows what they are doing to achieve the task;
    Being supportive of the other team members;
    Learning from any mistakes that were made during the task so that things can improve for next time.

A team is only as strong as its weakest link and it is important that everyone in the team works together and helps each other.”
INTERVIEW QUESTION 7 – What makes a good team player?
TIPS FOR ANSWERING THIS QUESTION:

    Try to give an example of when you have carried out a difficult/pressurised task under strict time constraints.
    Give a specific example and don’t forget to use the STAR technique in your response.

SAMPLE ANSWER

“Yes, I can. I am often required to carry out time sensitive tasks under pressure, but one particular incident springs to mind. I work in a large retail shop just outside of town. One Friday a few weeks ago, my manager called a team meeting and he explained to us all that a large delivery was due to arrive within a couple of hours’ time. Unfortunately, the delivery was a week early and he’d not had time to prepare. We were understaffed and it was already 4pm on Friday, so we only had one hour after the store had closed at 5pm to get the stock take accepted, loaded in store and checked for accuracy.

He asked all of us whether we would volunteer to help him out with the delivery. I immediately put my hand up and volunteered to help. I could see that he was slightly flustered and he clearly needed help from the team. Unfortunately, only I and one other member of staff offered to help. However, we were both determined to do a good job for our manager and we immediately started planning how we were going to get the stock unloaded, checked and placed in store within the one-hour timeslot allocated.

We decided to play to each others strengths. I would utilise my organisational and accuracy skills to check the stock as it

came off the lorry, whilst my colleague would carry it all to the stock room, as he was physically strong and extremely fit. As we progressed with the task we communicated with each other to make sure we were working to the required standards and time frame. The end result was that we completed the task thoroughly with just 6 minutes to spare. This gave us time to report back to our manager who thanked us for volunteering and working hard to achieve the goal.”

When I worked as a developer, I used Visual Studio .Net to develop web page applications, using C# Asp.Net, connected to an oracle database, 
in Oracle I created, tables, views, stored procedures and tasks.
So, I took a course in the university for testing, in this course I learned all the process of quality assurance, how to estimate, develop and execute test cases.
Also, I learned how to follow the entire process of a quality assurance, how to establish severity and priority of a bug, follow a bug life cycle, define an 
strategy and establish a plan (functional Test suites, smoke, integration, user acceptance). In this course I learned automation too.
In my first QA steps, I worked with TFS and automate in .NET, this company has its own framework but is common on all automations process, C# and selenium, 
basically.
Then I changed the tech so I worked with JavaScript and selenium, to test APIS.
And then I changed the technology again to do java, maven, selenium, testNG, jbehave, cucumber. All the changes were because I want to keep up to update.
For example, when I switched to javascript it was because I wanted to learn how to test the backend, and the change for java it was to follow the evolution of a test driven development methodology
to behavior driven development methodology.
We use Page Objects pattern to automate.
And at this moment I want to implement the continuous integration so we configure Jenkins, also we use git, in bitbucket repository.
Gitlab and bamboo keep in our radar, so we are searching info to evaluate the advantages.


In the las 5 years

Seen interest work with .NET again I know the language so I will feel comfortable 

We use the agile methodology so, we have a user storys in the backlog, a sprint planning, dailys, sprint reviews, analize the task we cant do, retrospective.

If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner.



Page Objects pattern
This is the most important pattern related to software automation. It enables you to create object repository with UI elements. 
Elements are separated from tests logic. This pattern makes code much more maintainable and reusable. Page objects design pattern

Facade pattern
The whole idea of facade design pattern is to provide simple and easy to use interface to a larger and more complex code, API or set of APIs. 
Most likely you don’t need everything provided by the API. So for ease and better maintainability, only API features that are needed gets exposed 
outside the facade. In this way, you simplify the API usage and you have control over how this external API is used and can prevent misunderstanding or misuse. 
Facade design pattern

Factory pattern
Factory pattern is used to create objects based on specific rules. You may have several classes implementing an interface. In your code, 
you do not want to bother defining which concrete class to instantiate or you might not know what object is suitable to get instantiated. 
This is why you handle the object creation task to the factory which knows exactly what object to create. With factory pattern, 
object creation is encapsulated. Factory design pattern

Singleton pattern
Singleton pattern is needed when you need exactly one object from a specific class in the whole application. Singleton and Null object patterns

Null object pattern
The idea is to make code simpler and safe by skipping null reference checks. Null object implements given interface and its methods are doing nothing. This makes the null object predictable. You can safely invoke methods on the null object without the threat of a NullReferenceException to break your application. Singleton and Null object patterns

Putting all together
Once you have gone through patterns one by one now it is time to put everything into one project. Complete guide how to use design patterns in automation post is showing how.

My hobbies are running, hiking and baking healthy desserts. Out of these, I enjoy running the most, especially marathons. 
Marathon running is a strict discipline and requires immense planning, working on your body and diet to achieve results. 
I have acquired the habit of self-motivation through this hobby. There are at least 8-9 marathons that happen every year in this city, 
so I am constantly gearing up to participate in and complete all of them. I cover a stretch of 10 kilometres every day and eat healthy to maintain my physique. 
It’s my aim to go for the Ironman triathlon that happens in Europe. It will take me at least 2 years to reach that level of fitness but 
I am excited to achieve that goal. Marathons remind me that I have to push myself and put one foot in front of the other to get closer to success.

I enjoy playing sports like football and cricket. I have represented my school and college in both state and national level tournaments. 
I honestly believe that my happy hormones are activated every time I am on the playground. Once I discovered the effect sports had on me, 
it was tough to give up. I still play 5-a-side football at least thrice a week at the local club. I look forward to these evenings with my team and it 
keeps me fit both physically and mentally.

I'm a people person. I really enjoy meeting and working with a lot of different people and known for being a great listener and clear communicator, 
whether I’m engaging with colleagues or interacting with employers.
I'm the kind of person who knows how to execute difficult tasks with precision, like to pay attention to all the details of a project and make sure that every 
task are completed in time.
I'm a creative thinker. I like to explore alternative solutions to problems and I have an open mind about what will work best. My creativity has made 
me an effective trobleshooter.
I'm an extremely organized person who has focused on producing results. While always realistic when setting goals, I consistently develop ways to 
efficiently achieve, and often exceed, those goals.
I enjoy solving problems, troubleshooting issues, and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. I thrive in team settings, and I think my skill in 
effectively communicating with others is what drives my ability to solve a variety of problems.


My ideal company would present exciting challenges that allow me to use my interest in and experience with growing sustainability efforts, 
and I see how my experience developing metrics could be useful here to propel the business forward


In five years, I hope to be on a career path that will lead to a supervisory position, with a long-range goal of eventually moving into upper management. I also plan to finish my university degree in engineer. Starting out in this exciting, fast-paced, customer service job would be a great way for me to learn about the organization.

If you want team members to trust you, you have to trust them.
Prioritize People Over Profit


I think when work for remotely have a comfortable environment, That’s because they claim they’re not in a loud environment or distracted by co-workers, to improve the imagination and get betters solutions.
Work remotely have the chance of distribute the time of other way, schedule the time to work in different tasks along the day, different time than the office.

Have a team is the best way to solve problem because we can have a brain storm to get different points of view of the same thing.


i've learned that i need to push myself to look around for more efficient solutions and to ensure that I delegate work to others to be as effective as possible
But I need to recognize that the new approach may be less effective than the tried and true.
I am careful not to always push  for the new way and to learn how others have been successful before me. 

I used to be shy, had a hard time interacting with users. It was difficult for me to answer their questions and help them. I spoke to my manager and
she gave me some great counsel on how to interact better  with people. She told me that if I focused more on helping the users rather than on my fear, I could
better assist them. For my part, I took a lot of courses of NLP and how to be a lider, to understand people and gain confident, the more confident I would be 
when trying to help the users. I tried to read more to complement my courses and I tried to ingnore my fear focus on helping them. 
Incredible, I am no longer shy with the users. I am confident when answering questions and I feel good to do test cases with them.

Questions to ask of a company culture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. How long have you been with the company?

“This is a question to ask each of your interviewers. If everyone you meet has only been there a short time you need to probe further,” says Career Counselor and Executive Coach Roy Cohen. “Unless the company is a startup, expanding rapidly, or the department is newly established, this is a serious red flag. High turnover could be a sign of low pay, long hours, lack of opportunity for career advancement, or incompetent management.”
8 Questions You Should Absolutely Ask An Interviewer
2. What was the last big achievement that was celebrated?

This question “gives [interviewers] the chance to reveal if employee efforts are acknowledged and appreciated and if people enjoy having company parties/gatherings,” says Valerie Streif, Senior Advisor at career services company Mentat. “If they don’t do anything to celebrate, it may be a thankless and cold environment.”
3. What’s the dress code like here?

“Companies that have no dress code or a very loose one are often less traditional than companies with full business-dress requirements. Certainly, there are exceptions, but I rarely find a company where everyone wears a full suit and tie or skirt suit every day that also has dogs in the office and nap rooms and free beer,” says Jill Santopietro Panall, HR consultant and owner of 21Oak HR Consulting, LLC. “Be careful, here, though, because an informal dress code doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s less pressure or stress. Many tech companies have no dress code but are also total pressure cookers. Appearance standards are only a small clue to the environment, not the whole picture.”
10 Interview Questions to Ask to Evaluate a Company’s Work-Life Balance
4. What activities do you offer for employees?

“If companies have softball leagues, trivia teams, company outings, retreats or other planned social events, it can often give you a clue to how important they think it is for co-workers to LIKE one another, not just work together,” Santopietro Panall says. This can be especially important if you “have recently moved, are entering the workforce after college or anyone else that needs a social aspect in the workplace,” adds Nikki Larchar, Co-Founder/Human Resource Business Partner at simplyHR LLC.

“On the flip side, that kind of togetherness may not be for everyone,” Santopietro Panall acknowledges. “If the thought of socializing with your co-workers leaves you cold, you may want to look for a company with a more 9-5 environment.”
5. What was the department’s biggest challenge last year and what did you learn from it?

It may come across as an obvious question, but it actually does a great job at revealing “whether or not the company blames processes or people when something goes wrong. The former indicates that they are a continuous learning organization and the latter may be a sign of a blame culture,” says Mary Grace Gardner, career strategist at The Young Professionista. “Listen to who or what gets blamed for the failure and if they have taken steps to learn from it.”

Keep an ear out for how their answer hints at the degree of politics present in the office, too. “Company politics play a huge role in overall job satisfaction, and it’s important to know ahead of time how decisions are made and conflicts are resolved,” shares Natasha Bowman, Chief Consultant at Performance ReNEW and author of the upcoming book You Can’t Do That At Work! 100 Common Mistakes That Managers Make.
6. How much time do the owners/leaders/founders spend in the office?

“This question tells you whether or not you have leaders in place who are in touch with the work and making knowledgeable decisions. The best and brightest ideas oftentimes come directly from the people actually doing the work, so if a leader rarely spends time with staff, it points to a lack of innovation and support in their culture,” says Gardner.

This question may not be quite as important to ask of a large business, but “in a small business, that interaction with the top level may be key to you getting ahead, being able to get things done and having that person’s vision be carried out by their team,” Santopietro Panall says. It “might also give you a key to the level of the workaholism that you can expect there. If the recruiter says ‘oh, our CEO Sally is here 90 hours a week, she never takes a day off!’ you’re going to know that the culture is going to be very focused on putting in a lot of hours with a lot of face time.”
7. What do people on the team that I’d be joining do for lunch every day?

“Finding out what people tend to do on their lunch hour will tell you whether they are slammed with work, don’t want to spend time with their colleagues, or tend to be social and enjoy each other’s company,” Bowman says. “This information can also tell you whether or not your potential colleagues might be more extroverted or introverted. Depending on your own preferences, this response can give you some valuable insight into the team that you’re joining.”
An Exec Reveals What You Should Look For In A Company’s Culture
8. How do you measure success and over what time frame?  How are these metrics determined?

If you want to avoid a boss with outrageous expectations, this is the question to ask. “Before you accept an offer you need to know that your new boss has realistic expectations with respect to what you will accomplish and by when,” Cohen says. “No matter how attractive an offer may be, if you do not, or cannot, deliver results you will fail. So, if you are told that the bar is outrageously high and you don’t have enough time to come up to speed, think twice before accepting the terms without discussion or negotiation.”
9. Would you be willing to show me around the office?

This question is probably best saved for a last-round interview so you don’t seem too intrusive, but “taking a walk around the workspace is a great way to get a real feel for the day-to-day culture,” Larchar says. “Are individuals interacting with one another? Do the workers look stressed? Are the individual workspaces decorated? What is the setup of the office? Does the work space seem inclusive? How are the departments organized? If you thrive on working with others, you’ll want a work environment where that feels natural.”

One thing Santopietro Panall recommends keeping an eye on in particular is how many senior-level employees have their own offices. “It’s a clue to how structured and hierarchical the company is,” she says. “Companies with few or no private offices tend to be less top-down than companies with a lot of private offices or a whole CEO floor. There’s a strong trend, in many businesses, of removing private spaces in offices and making all space communal — some companies are loving it and finding it effective and others are dreading it, but whether a company would even consider it is a sign of how much they are trying to embrace a certain kind of flexible, collaborative work style.”
10. Does the company give back to the community? In what ways?

“If it is important that you and the company are aligned in terms of shared priorities such as corporate responsibility or giving back, then understanding their level of involvement offers important insight,” Cohen says. “Some companies make a point of promoting their community activities. Others view philanthropy and volunteering as a distraction. At the very least, if there is a disconnect, then you will not be disappointed when the company opts for limited commitment.”

“This also ties back into the question regarding social activities,” Larchar adds. “Are there events outside of work that the company supports and do they align with what you believe in or value as an individual?”
11. How many of the current team members have flexible schedules?

“Rather than asking ‘Can I have a flexible schedule?’ in your initial conversation… ask if others already do,” recommends Santopietro Panall. “If nobody does now, you’ll know that the culture is more formal and any requests for flex-time or alternate work arrangements may be met with less enthusiasm. If lots of people have flexible schedules, you’ll get a read on the work-life balance.”

It’s important to keep in mind the level of seniority for flexible employees as well, however. “It’s not helpful to you if you’re applying to a mid-level position and a senior manager has a flexible work schedule. Ask specifically about what location and scheduling flexibility exists for others in positions similar to yours,” Bowman says.
4 Ways to Ask For a Flexible Work Schedule
12. What continuing learning opportunities do you have for your employees?

“Besides the benefits of getting a degree or a certificate program subsidized by the company, this question offers insight into several other important aspects of company culture,” Cohen says. “Does the company view continuing education and advanced degrees as adding value to your profile? Does the company make time for you to pursue outside training? And even more important, if there is time for training, does this mean working there will allow for balance and a life outside?”

Beyond that, it’s also a good indicator of whether or not a company cares about employee retention. “Pay attention to if a program exists and what it comprises of: conferences, mentorship or an internal leadership development program are all positive signs that the company is interested in retaining its employees for the long haul,” Gardner says.
